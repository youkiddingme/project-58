    <p>Harry Potter embodies all that is good within a young boy thrown out into a strange world trying to make it on his own. As Harry matures each year in the subsequent books, he transforms into a young man who struggles with all too human feelings as jealousy, reluctance, lack of fortitude, and hasty decision making.</p>
